#### Professional Summary
Backend developer with specialization in Python, C++, and C#, with experience 
using Unity for interactive 3D applications and Django for web development.
Trained in bioinformatics research, with technical expertise in developing 
scientific software, particularly for real-time simulations in virtual 
environments. Sensitivity to programming best practices and software quality.


#### Academic background
My academic journey was rooted in structural bioinformatics and large-scale
simulations, working at the intersection of physics, chemistry, and computer
science. Most of my work centered on software development to address complex 
scientific challenges.

Notably, I developed a comprehensive software suite for interactive molecular 
simulations (IMS), enabling real-time human interaction with ongoing 
simulations. This was particularly impactful for studying the insertion 
profile of membrane proteins.

This experience laid the groundwork for my focus on designing and implementing 
robust software architectures for high-performance scientific tools.
