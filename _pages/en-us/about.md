I am a bioinformatician specialized in structural bioinformatics and large-scale
simulations, working at the intersection of physics, chemistry, and computer 
science. 

I have particularly focused on developing and implementing a 
comprehensive software suite for interactive molecular simulations (IMS), 
enabling real-time human interaction with ongoing simulations, especially for 
studying the insertion profile of membrane proteins. 

Currently, I am further 
specializing as a scientific developer, enhancing my skills in software 
engineering, in particular software architecture.
