#### Academic background
My academic journey was rooted in structural bioinformatics and large-scale
simulations, working at the intersection of physics, chemistry, and computer
science. Most of my work centered on software development to address complex 
scientific challenges.

Notably, I developed a comprehensive software suite for interactive molecular 
simulations (IMS), enabling real-time human interaction with ongoing 
simulations. This was particularly impactful for studying the insertion 
profile of membrane proteins.

This experience sparked my focus on designing and implementing robust software 
architectures for high-performance scientific tools, with a strong sensitivity 
to programming best practices and software quality.
