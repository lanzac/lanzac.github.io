	abstract = {Abstract BioSpring is an innovative tool for interactive molecular modeling and simulation, designed to explore the dynamics of biological structures in real time. Using an augmented elastic network model, the BioSpring framework enables researchers to intuitively examine complex biomolecules, and it combines real-time feedback with the user's experience. This capability makes it ideal for initial analysis of molecular systems, protein–protein and protein–DNA docking, protein mechanics, and protein–membrane interactions. The multi-resolution modeling approach combines accuracy and efficiency, supporting user-driven analysis of molecular interactions, conformational flexibility, and structural mechanics. This framework improves upon traditional methods in terms of robustness, accessibility, and ease of use, while requiring only modest computational resources and enabling a fast turnaround time to obtain initial results. It provides insights into molecular function and dynamics that advance the field of structural biology. Source code, executables, and examples for the BioSpring simulation engine are available at https://biospring.mol3d.tech.},

  abstract = {Interactive Molecular Dynamics (IMD) is a real-time simulation technique that allows scientists to interact with virtual molecular systems. Users can observe a simulation in progress in real time and manipulate the motion of individual atoms and molecules by applying forces, and receive feedback on the dynamic response of these systems in interactive time. The development of IMD has been influenced by technological and algorithmic advances in simulation tools as well as advances in human-computer interaction, including haptic devices or augmented and virtual reality approaches, and increasingly affordable devices. Scientific and practical applications include mechanobiology research, determination of experimental structures, and nanoscale property visualization for dissemination. IMD has made significant advances in performance, visualization, and data analysis.},

	abstract = {The insertion of proteins into membranes is crucial for understanding their function in many biological processes. In this work, we present UNILIPID, a universal implicit lipid-protein description as a methodology for dealing with implicit membranes. UNILIPID is independent of the scale of representation and can be applied at the level of all atoms, coarse-grained particles down to the level of a single bead per amino acid. We provide example implementations for these scales and demonstrate the versatility of our approach by accurately reflecting the free energy of transfer for each amino acid. In addition to single membranes, we describe the analytical implementation of double membranes and show that UNILIPID is well suited for modeling at multiple scales. We generalize to membranes of arbitrary shape. With UNILIPID, we provide a methodological framework for a simple and general parameterization tuned to reproduce a selected reference hydrophobicity scale. The software we provide along with the methodological description is optimized for specific user features such as real-time response, live visual analysis, and virtual reality experiences.},

	abstract = {(1) Background: We developed an algorithm to perform interactive molecular simulations (IMS) of protein alignment in membranes, allowing on-the-fly monitoring and manipulation of such molecular systems at various scales. (2) Methods: UnityMol, an advanced molecular visualization software; MDDriver, a socket for data communication; and BioSpring, a Spring network simulation engine, were extended to perform IMS. These components are designed to easily communicate with each other, adapt to other molecular simulation software, and provide a development framework for adding new interaction models to simulate biological phenomena such as protein alignment in the membrane at a fast enough rate for real-time experiments. (3) Results: We describe in detail the integration of an implicit membrane model for Integral Membrane Protein And Lipid Association (IMPALA) into our IMS framework. Our implementation can cover multiple levels of representation, and the degrees of freedom can be tuned to optimize the experience. We explain the validation of this model in an interactive and exhaustive search mode. (4) Conclusions: Protein positioning in model membranes can now be performed interactively in real time.},

  abstract = {Since the dawn of the computer age, scientists have designed devices to represent molecular structures and developed tools to simulate their dynamic behavior in silico. To this day, these tools remain central to our understanding of biomolecular phenomena. In contrast to other fields such as fluid mechanics or meteorology, the observation of molecular motions at the atomic level remains a major experimental challenge. Continuous advances in computer graphics and numerical computation, combined with the emergence of human–computer interaction approaches, led to the methodology of so-called “interactive molecular simulations”, characterized by two main features. First, the possibility to visualize a running simulation in interactive time, that is, compatible with human perception. Second, the possibility to manipulate the simulation interactively by imposing a force, changing a biophysical property, or editing runtime parameters on the fly. Such simulations are still little used in computational biology, where it is more common to run a series of offline simulations and then visualize and analyze the results. However, interactive molecular simulation tools promise to handle time-consuming tasks such as the modeling of particularly complex biomolecular structures more efficiently or to support approaches such as Rational Drug Design with regard to pharmaceutical applications.},
